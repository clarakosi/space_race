 * REMINDER: in order for this to work we must pass the random values as arguments to the action creator outside of this reducer.
 * so, whatever component that will call for a random color must first import RandomTeam from RandomGenerator.js and also import the action creator for
 * this reducer which is RandomTeamAction.
 * 
 * and then dispatch the action like so:    RandomTeamAction(RandomTeam());
